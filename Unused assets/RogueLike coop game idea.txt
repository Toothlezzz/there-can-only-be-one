		There can only be one
story:
what if the idea is that, adventurers(players), are trying to become the "chosen one", and 
they cooporate together to try and reach that, needing to face different enemies,
where at the end, there can only be one
"chosen one", and that's why they have to battle for it. (not sure yet.ref 3rd idea for coop aspect)

game design:
whole basis is it's a rogue like game like vampire survivors/swarm(league of legends)/hades
game should take place in a 2.5D space, there should be different classes with different 
abilities. 

1. what if players start with melee combat no weapons their classes are defined by weapons
similar to Albion. (Rob's idea) 



coop aspect:
1. players can do synergy combos with their abilities(their abilities fuse/empower together or
something in that spectre).
2. add mini games (totally skill based / fun etc..), for a chance any of the players to get 
a boost/enchantment/powerup
, there would be pillars in the world that indicate it's a minigame area.
similar to swarm(league of legends), but rather the players would compete against each other.

3. Maybe at the end of the run/floor, 
make it so the final hurdle is actually each and one of you,
so the players have to fight each other to be the victor.
